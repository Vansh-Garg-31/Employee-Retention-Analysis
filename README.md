**Employee Performance and Retention Analysis **

Overview 
This project analyzes HR data to uncover trends in employee performance and retention. It uses statistical analysis and 
visual insights to identify the key drivers of productivity and attrition, ultimately guiding HR in making informed, 
data-backed decisions. 

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
• Basic structure and types of data assessed. 
• Null values found in education and previous_year_rating were imputed using mode and median, respectively. 
• Outliers in age and training scores were visualized. 
• Initial trend observations were noted, such as: 
▪ Disproportionate KPI performance across genders. 
▪ Department-wise employee distribution. 
2. Data Preprocessing 
• Missing values handled appropriately. 
• Categorical variables like KPIs_met_more_than_80 were converted to category type. 
• Data consistency maintained for proper visualization and metric calculations. 
3. Key Metrics Analysis 
• Average Training Score by Department: Revealed higher engagement in Sales and Operations. 
• Previous Year Rating by Awards Won: Validated that recognition leads to stronger prior performance. 
• Length of Service by KPI Achievement: Indicated possible early exit of high performers. 
4. Retention Trends Analysis 
• Education vs. Retention: Graduates showed relatively higher retention. 
• Age vs. Service Length: Older employees tend to stay longer, younger ones are more mobile. 
• Department Influence: Some departments show low training averages and may need focus. 
5. Predictive Insights 
• High KPI achievers may exit early – need retention strategies. 
• Recognizing employees improves performance – increase transparency and frequency. 
• Younger employees are more likely to leave – strengthen early engagement. 
6. Recommendations 
• Introduce retention programs for top performers. 
• Standardize training practices across departments. 
• Launch employee award systems. 
• Provide mentorship and career growth opportunities, especially for new or young hires. 

**Conclusion **
This analysis successfully: 
• Identified key factors influencing employee performance and retention. 
• Revealed department- and demographic-based trends. 
• Delivered clear, HR-actionable recommendations. 
The organization can now better retain talent, boost performance, and improve overall employee engagement using 
data-informed strategies.
